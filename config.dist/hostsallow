# Access control list for WHOIS++ server
#
# Format is 
#
#  [hostname|ipaddress]: [allow|deny|poll]
#
# Where hostname and ipaddress are regular expressions which the client
# info is matched against.  Note that the first match is taken as the
# definitive answer, and that the default is to deny everything - i.e.
# you need to have an entry which says that everyone is allowed to
# search if you make to make the server publicly available!

# Let us (the developers) search and poll for centroids.  We'd like to
# be able to poll your server so that we can extract centroids for use
# in the ROADS development process.  Hope that's OK with you :-)
