During a linkchecker-run over our local Webfiles,
we found these 'bad' URLs in documents maintained
by you. If any of these problems were mentioned in
earlier messages of this sort (if you have recieved
any), we strongly suggest that you either remove
or substitute those particular references from the
named pages.
