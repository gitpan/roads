<P>
A template with the same handle as the one you have given or that was
automatically generated by this program already exists.  Try going back
to the previous FORM in your browser, editing the "Handle" field and
resubmitting your template.  If you leave the Handle field blank the 
ROADS software will automatically generate a unique handle for the
template.
