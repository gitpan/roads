<H1>Error: Can't create temporary template</H1>

<P>
The template editor has encountered an internal error in that it can not
generate a temporary copy of the template with a handle of <handle> in the
system's temporary directory.  This could be because the temporary 
directory is not writable by this script or because the disc it is on is
full.  Please contact your system administrator, <A
HREF="mailto:<roadssysadminemail>"><roadssysadminemail></A> to report this
problem.
