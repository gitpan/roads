<H1>Couldn't add template to inverted index</H1>
 
<P>

Due to an internal problem, the template with handle <Handle>
could not be added to the inverted index.  This could be because the
inverted index directory or one of its subdirectories cannot be written to by
the user that this program is running under - contact <A HREF"<ROADSSYSADMINEMAIL"><ROADSSYSADMINEMAIL</A>
in order to get this problem rectified.
