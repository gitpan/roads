<P>
All of the templates in the ROADS v0 source directory have now been added to
the ROADS v1 database.  Once you are sure that the ROADS v1 database is
operating correctly you can delete the ROADS v0 templates and inverted index.
Note that you might want to make a back up of both onto a tape or disc before
doing that!  Just to be on the safe side... :-)
