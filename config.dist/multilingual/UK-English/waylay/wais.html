<H1>WAIS database</H1>

The resource you selected,<P>

<EM><MYURL></EM><P>

is a database accessed via the WAIS protocol.<P>

WAIS is not commonly supported by World Wide Web browsers, and so
you may find that you have difficulty in using this URL.<P>

Typically, browsers may be configured to speak the WAIS protocol
via a <EM>proxy server</EM>, such as the 
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/httpd/">CERN <EM>httpd</EM></A>.  There
are also some WWW based gateways to WAIS.  Check out 
<A HREF="http://www.wais.com/">the WAIS, Inc WWW server</A> for
more information about these.<P>

If you have working WAIS support, selecting the URL above will
connect you to the WAIS database in question.<P>
