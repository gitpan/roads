<H1>Field Descriptions for DOCUMENT, SOFTWARE, IMAGE, SOUND, VIDEO,
MAILARCHIVE, USENET and FAQ IAFA Template Types</H1>

This document is extracted from the IAFA Templates Internet Draft and is
intended to provide a little online guidance on the sort of the things
that should be placed in the various fields.  Note that not all fields
need to be filled in; which ones you use as a "minimum" set depend on
your application.

The templates for Documents, Datasets, Mailing List Archives, Usenet
Archives, Software Packages, Images, Sounds, Videos and Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQ) files all contain the same fields, but have different
"Template-Type" values.  The standard Template-Types are:

<A NAME="note1">&lt;1&gt;  The intention of this field is to define the category
     of the object. For example, in the case of documents it
     could be "Technical Report", or "Conference Paper" and
     the name and date of the conference at which the paper
     was presented. It may also be something like "General
     Guide" or "User manual".
<P>
<A NAME="note2">&lt;2&gt;  Objects are often available in several formats. For
     example, documents may be in PostScript, ASCII text,
     DVI etc. For images this may be GIF, JPEG, TIFF etc.
     Format should be specified in MIME type syntax and
