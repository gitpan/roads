Title: Internet Library of Early Journals
Alternative-Title:
Description: To provide expanded access to a realistic sample of 18th and 19th century journals, including "Gentleman's Magazine", "Notes and Queries" and "The Builder". The service will be monitored and the intended outcome is firm evidence and recommendations on the technological, economic and user acceptability aspects of digitisation which could serve as a basis for the development of a national digitisation programme for out-of-copyright journals.
