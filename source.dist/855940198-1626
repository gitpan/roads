Project-Acronym:
Short-Title:
Title: A study of the economic implications of different models of publishing   scholarly electronic journals for professional societies and other small or   specialist owners and publishers.
Alternative-Title:
Description: With the advent of the electronic journal,   the economic threat of 'free   riding', obtaining the benefits without contributing to the underlying costs
    of a service, may curtail both the growth of electronic journals and affect
    the viability of some specialist or small publishers, including some
    professional societies.
    The aim of this study is to better understand the economics of traditional
    and new forms of journal production, particularly as it effects smaller and
    specialist journal publishers.
