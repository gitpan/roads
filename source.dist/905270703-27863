Description: RIDING is a project supported by the Yorkshire and Humberside Universities Association (YHUA), a
 group formed in 1993 by the Vice-Chancellors of the region's universities to provide a forum to enhance
 and promote the HE contribution to regional development. All the universities are committed to regional
 collaboration in many activities, including shared access to information resources. The university libraries
 of the YHUA institutions already have formal co-operative arrangements providing reciprocal access
 and borrowing rights for academic staff and research students, and there are many examples of less
 formal arrangements, particularly among libraries in the same city. The collections represented by the
 participating institutions are of outstanding value regionally, nationally and internationally, and enhancing
 access will have far-reaching benefits. In addition, two other libraries are RIDING members – Leeds
 Library and Information Services (the public library in Leeds) and the British Library Document Supply
 Centre (BLDSC) – and bring particular databases, expertise, scope and breadth to the Project. The
 RIDING consortium is completed by Fretwell-Downing Informatics.
