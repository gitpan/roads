Short-Title:
Title: MOving to Distributed Environments for Library Services
Alternative-Title:
Description: An applications framework which enables the effective management of distributed collections of autonomous, heterogeneous information resources and services now needs to be constructed. Services for discovery (catalogues and bibliographic services), ordering, publishing and archiving of electronic and print materials are being developed and integrated. The MODELS project will provide a forum within which the UK library and information communities can explore some of the issues that now need to be addressed in the construction of such a framework.
