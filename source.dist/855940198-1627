Short-Title:
Title: Impact of on-demand publishing and electronic resource banks on   teaching, students and libraries.
Alternative-Title:
Description: Starting with a review of current provision   and costs of reserve and short   loan collections, this study would explore the extent to which on-demand
    publishing and electronic resource banks would improve current
    arrangements,  particularly in terms of library costs, student satisfaction
    and teaching. Among the aims of the study would be to identify the
    particular contribution electronic approaches can make to streamlining
    library services and to effectively providing 'just-in-time' learning
    resources linked to course lifecycles.
