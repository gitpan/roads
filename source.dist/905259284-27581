Description: M25 Link aims to establish a pilot virtual clump to provide single search access to the library catalogues
         of six members of the M25 Consortium of Higher Education Libraries. The M25 Consortium was
         established in 1993 and the resources within its membership amount to about 20% of UK HEI libraries
         provision, with a great diversity of institutions and richness of collections. Within the pilot group and the
         Consortium as a whole, there are significant holdings which are not represented in national physical
         clumps such as COPAC, but which are useful resources that deserve greater and wider exploitation.
         The project will run for two years from January 1998.
