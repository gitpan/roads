Title: MALIBU: Managing the Hybrid Library for the Benefit of Users
Alternative-Title: 
Description: MALIBU aims to develop examples of `hybrid libraries', focusing on the humanities, in each of the three
               major partner institutions. These will offer a range of electronic services integrated with more traditional
               services and directly involving users throughout the life of the project. In doing so the project will
               develop definitions for hybrid library services and generalised models for the organisation and
               management of these services. These models will be tested in a number of test-bed institutions before
               being distributed throughout the Higher Education community.
