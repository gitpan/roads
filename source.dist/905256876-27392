Description: To develop a working model of the hybrid library within both a teaching and research context,
           seamlessly integrating access to a wide range of printed and electronic information sources, local and
           remote, using a Web-based interface, and in a way which will be universally applicable. The model will
           focus on a series of six inter-related modules (user registration and induction; ordering and delivery of
           materials; metadata index for printed and electronic sources; teaching and learning; publication and
           digitisation; access gateways) which will be developed for and applied across six subject areas (history
           and archaeology, business, education, physics, sports science, medicine).
