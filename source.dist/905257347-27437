Short-Title: 
Title: HYLIFE: Hybrid Library of the Future
Alternative-Title: 
Description: The project is about how best to deliver the mixture of print and electronic services likely to be required
           of higher education libraries in the foreseeable future.
           The project will use widely available standard technologies, moving with the mainstream current as new
           developments become standard. The demonstrator interfaces, which will form the core of the project,
           will be open and system-independent and will take a two-stage approach with a Web interface initially
           providing access to a range of services including the library catalogue, then moving on to provide
           Z39.50 capability as a development of the Web interface.
