Title: HEADLINE: Hybrid Electronic Access and Delivery in the Library Networked Environment
Alternative-Title: 
Description: The overall aim of the project is to develop and implement a working model of the hybrid library in a
               range of real-life academic situations. There is a strong emphasis on managing the presentation of
               resources to the user and on integrating a wide range of both resources and delivery options. The
               subject coverage of the project will be economics, finance, business and management but the model is
               intended to be widely applicable and the consortium elements to be readily scalable to larger groupings
               of libraries.
