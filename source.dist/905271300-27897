Description: The CEDARS project aims to address strategic, methodological and practical
             issues and will provide guidance for libraries in best practice for digital preservation. CURL (The
             Consortium of University Research Libraries) is uniquely placed to lead this project. Digital preservation
             is a key issue for all its members. Under the overall direction of the CURL Management Board,
             CEDARS will be based across three lead sites (Oxford, Leeds and Cambridge). Wider involvement
             from the community will come through focus groups, workshops and discussion lists.
